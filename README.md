# Deep-Analysis-of-US-College-System


-	Studying advanced experimentation techniques: MLE/bootstrap, RDDs, instrumental variables, ignorability, multi-arm bandits 
-	Preprocessed the US College dataset from DoEd by investigating data collection process to fill blanks and ensure accuracy.
-	Performed inference on outcome variables with parametric and non-parametric assumptions via t-test, confidence intervals, KS test for normality and permutation test. Utilized Bonferroni correction to determine significant coefficients from OLS output.
-	Established baseline OLS and LR and measured R2/MSE via CV. Improved  model w/ LASSO CV and stepwise regression.
